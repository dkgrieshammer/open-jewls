Open Jewls is an open source product design software prototype created for my final thesis of my design studies at [KISD](www.kisd.de).
Cobbled together with [Processing](http://processing.org/) / Java and the great [Hemesh](http://hemesh.wblut.com/) &amp; [ControlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) libraries.

It's pretty alpha and there is great chance to crash the app especially with wiring vronoi-cuts, but you can already export valid .stl-files for printing;
